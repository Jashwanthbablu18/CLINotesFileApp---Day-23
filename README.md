# 🗂️ Day 23 - Notes File App (File Handling CRUD)

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Day 23** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**. Today, I built a handy CLI-based **Notes App** using file handling — a real-world use case that’s simple yet powerful.

---

## 📌 What’s This About?
Today’s focus: **File Handling in Python**  
- Working with `.txt` files using `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `readlines()`
- Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via command-line

---

## 💭 Why Is This Useful?
Many beginner apps need to persist data — and that’s where file handling shines!  
Whether you're building a to-do app, config system, or simple logs, this gives you full control without needing a database.

---

## ✨ Features

Here’s what the app can do:
- 📝 **Add Notes** — Appends new note lines to a `.txt` file
- 📖 **Read All Notes** — Reads and lists saved notes
- ✏️ **Update Notes** — Modify a specific note by index
- 🗑️ **Delete Notes** — Remove a note by index

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

Built with:
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 📂 File handling: `open(mode='a'|'r'|'w')`
- 🧯 Error handling for missing files & invalid input
- 🔁 CLI menu loop for interaction

## 🚀 Getting It Running

### ✅ What You’ll Need
Just Python 3 and a terminal!  
Run the program with:
```bash
python Day-23Code.py
